# Task Management
This is Task management application that has two functionalities:
1) Adding, updating, searching and deleting users
2) Adding, updating, searching and deleting tasks

## General guidelines
This is backend code of this project that can also run separately without frontend. To use only backend, run the code and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` in browser.
In that case, the functionality can be tested with Postman.
For this project to work, it is necessary to configure application.properties file and add a schema in SQL.
